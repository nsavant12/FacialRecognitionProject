# FacialRecognitionProject
This application takes webcam input to detect any recognized faces. In order to give the program a image you upload it into the imagesAttendance file, and then simply 
run the program and point the camera at the subject and the program will be able to detect whether it is the correct face or not and document it.


Note: Currently doesn't work because face_recognition is no longer a supported Python Library.
